# bookmarklets

paste the source code into a bookmark's `url` field to create a bookmarklet.
firefox + github won't run bookmarklets, showing a warning instead:

    CSP WARN: Directive inline script base restriction violated

currently only `github.js`, which redirects you to a repo's github.io page.
